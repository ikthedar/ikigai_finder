# ikigai_finder
Written using Django.

Implemented things I learned from the previous chat app project.

Research on what features can I add more?
- Let the users add their passion, their love, their vocation
- Let them choose from existing ones
- Based on that, show a predicted ikigai

Find out any existing bugs in the html, css templates. Fix those first.
